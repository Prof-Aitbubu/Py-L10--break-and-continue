Using `continue` in a `**while loop**` is **less common** than in a `for loop`, but it can still be **very useful** ‚Äî especially when:

### ‚úÖ You Should Use `continue` in a `while` loop When:

1. **You want to skip part of the loop body** without stopping the loop entirely.
2. You need to **validate input** or skip **invalid data** during each loop cycle.
3. You're working with **dynamic conditions** (e.g., changing variables inside the loop).

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è But Be Careful:

* Unlike `for` loops, `while` loops **don‚Äôt automatically progress** ‚Äî you must manually update variables **before or after `continue`**.
* If you forget that, it may cause an **infinite loop**.

---

### üîç Example 1: Skip Even Numbers

```python
num = 0
while num < 10:
    num += 1
    if num % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(num)
```

üîπ This prints only **odd numbers**, because even numbers are skipped.

---

### üîç Example 2: Skip Empty User Input

```python
while True:
    user_input = input("Enter something (or 'q' to quit): ")
    if user_input == "":
        continue
    if user_input.lower() == 'q':
        break
    print("You entered:", user_input)
```

üîπ It **skips empty input** and **exits on 'q'**.

---

### üîç Example 3: Input Validation

```python
attempts = 0

while attempts < 5:
    password = input("Enter password: ")
    if len(password) < 6:
        print("Too short!")
        attempts += 1
        continue
    print("Password accepted!")
    break
```

üîπ Skips short passwords and lets user try again.

---

### ‚úÖ Rule of Thumb:

* Use `continue` in `while` loops only if:

  * You‚Äôre **certain** the loop **won‚Äôt get stuck** (infinite loop).
  * You handle **updates or inputs** correctly.
* If your logic is getting complicated, consider **refactoring** the loop or using `for` instead.

Perfect! Here are **üîü `while` loop tasks using `continue`** to help you practice and understand how `continue` works in dynamic loop conditions:

---

### üîπ 1. Skip Even Numbers

**Task:** Print only odd numbers from 1 to 10.

```python
num = 0
while num < 10:
    num += 1
    if num % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(num)
```

---

### üîπ 2. Skip Empty Input

**Task:** Ask the user to enter their name. Skip if input is empty.

```python
while True:
    name = input("Enter your name (or 'q' to quit): ")
    if name == "":
        continue
    if name.lower() == 'q':
        break
    print("Hello,", name)
```

---

### üîπ 3. Skip Numbers Not Divisible by 3

**Task:** Print numbers less than 20 that are divisible by 3.

```python
num = 0
while num < 20:
    num += 1
    if num % 3 != 0:
        continue
    print(num)
```

---

### üîπ 4. Skip Words That Are Too Short

**Task:** Ask for words and skip if shorter than 4 characters.

```python
while True:
    word = input("Enter a word (or 'stop'): ")
    if word == "stop":
        break
    if len(word) < 4:
        continue
    print("Long enough:", word)
```

---

### üîπ 5. Skip If Already Seen

**Task:** Skip if the user enters the same word again.

```python
seen = []
while True:
    word = input("Enter a new word (or 'end'): ")
    if word == 'end':
        break
    if word in seen:
        print("Already entered!")
        continue
    seen.append(word)
    print("New word:", word)
```

---

### üîπ 6. Skip Negative Numbers

**Task:** Accept numbers, but only print positives.

```python
while True:
    n = int(input("Enter number (0 to stop): "))
    if n == 0:
        break
    if n < 0:
        continue
    print("Positive number:", n)
```

---

### üîπ 7. Skip Passwords That Don‚Äôt Have Numbers

**Task:** Ask for a password and skip if it doesn't contain any digits.

```python
while True:
    pwd = input("Enter password: ")
    if any(char.isdigit() for char in pwd):
        print("Password accepted")
        break
    print("Must include a number!")
    continue
```

---

### üîπ 8. Skip Words Starting with 'a'

**Task:** Enter words and skip those starting with `'a'`.

```python
while True:
    word = input("Type a word (or 'exit'): ")
    if word == 'exit':
        break
    if word.startswith('a'):
        continue
    print("Accepted word:", word)
```

---

### üîπ 9. Skip Input Longer Than 8 Characters

**Task:** Only print input if it's less than or equal to 8 characters.

```python
while True:
    text = input("Enter a short word (or 'bye'): ")
    if text == 'bye':
        break
    if len(text) > 8:
        print("Too long, try again.")
        continue
    print("Accepted:", text)
```

---

### üîπ 10. Skip Repeating Characters

**Task:** Ask for characters. Skip if the same character was entered last time.

```python
last_char = ""
while True:
    char = input("Enter a character (or 'x' to stop): ")
    if char == 'x':
        break
    if char == last_char:
        continue
    print("You typed:", char)
    last_char = char
```
